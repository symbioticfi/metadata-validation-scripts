# AI Agent Guidelines

## Purpose

This document defines how AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) should operate when contributing to the Symbiotic Metadata Validator project.

## Source of Truth

All AI agents **must read and follow**  
[`./.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md)  
before generating or modifying any code.

This file contains the complete, authoritative rules and conventions for the project.
**Nothing overrides the instructions defined there.**

## Summary

- Follow `copilot-instructions.md` strictly.
- Use `README.md` only for high-level understanding.
